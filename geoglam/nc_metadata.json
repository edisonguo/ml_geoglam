  "summary": "Vegetation fractional cover represents the exposed proportion of Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV), Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) and Bare Soil (BS) within each pixel. In forested canopies the photosynthetic or non-photosynthetic portions of trees may obscure those of the grass layer and/or bare soil. The MODIS Fractional Cover product is derived from the MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product (MCD43A4, collection 5). A suite of derivative are also produced, namely total vegetation cover (PV+NPV), monthly fractional cover and total vegetation cover, monthly anomaly of total cover against the time series, and three-monthly total cover difference. MODIS fractional cover has been validated for Australia.  ",

  "history": "Version 3.0: Fractional cover was derived using a linear unmixing methodology (Guerschman et al. 2015). The method uses all 7 MODIS bands and adds log transforms and band interaction terms to account for non-linearities in the spectral mixing. A cross-validation step was also included to select the optimal number of singular values to avoid over-fitting. The calibration and validation steps used 1171 field observations across Australia. Overall, the model fitted and applied to MCD43A4 fractional cover has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.9%, 18.1% and 16.6% for the PV, NPV and BS fractions respectively (percentage cover)\nVersion 3.1: Same as Version 3.0 with the following modifications: 1- input data changed to MODIS Collection 6.0 (MCD43A4.006) (see source). 2- calibration dataset expanded to include ~3022 field measurement sites accross Australia. 3- overall accuracy improved to an RMSE of 11.3%, 16.1% and 14.7% for the PV, NPV and BS fractions respectively.\nMonthly vegetation cover is calculated from the 8-day composites using a medoid method as described in Gill et al. \nMonthly anomalies show the difference between total vegetation cover (PV+NPV) in a given month and the mean total vegetation cover for that month in all years available\nMonthly deciles show the decile (ranking) for the total vegetation cover in a given month in relation to the vegetation cover in that month for all years in the time series.

MODIS NBAR data are 16-day composites in a phased production strategy: Produced every 8 days with 16 days of acquisition (i.e., production period 2001001 includes acquisition between Days 001 and 016, production period 2001009 includes acquisition between Days 009 and 024). Both Terra and Aqua data are used in the generation of this product, providing the highest probability for quality input data.",
